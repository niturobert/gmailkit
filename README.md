## What is it?

GmailKit is a Reddit client that looks just like Gmail. It's been developed in 3 hours. There are inconsistencies and bugs. It's just a joke.

It was inspired by [this github project](https://github.com/pcottle/MSOutlookit/)

## How to use it?

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can also use the [online version](http://niturobert.github.io/gmailkit/).
